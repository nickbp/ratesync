What you'll need to get started (ubuntu package names):

$ sudo apt-get install build-essential cmake libmpdclient-dev libtag1-dev

Example initial build (after prerequisites are installed):

ratesong$ mkdir src out
ratesong$ mv * .git src
(you should now have two subdirectories: src/ and out/)
ratesong$ cd out
ratesong/out$ cmake ../src
(this generates makefiles -- cmake may also be used for configuring build parameters (optional))
ratesong/out$ make
ratesong/out$ ./ratesong -h

All set!
