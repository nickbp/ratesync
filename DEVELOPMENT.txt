What you'll need to get started (ubuntu package names):

$ sudo apt-get install build-essential cmake libmpdclient-dev libtag1-dev

Example initial build (after prerequisites are installed):

ratesync$ mkdir src out
ratesync$ mv * .git src
(you should now have two subdirectories: src/ and out/)
ratesync$ cd out
ratesync/out$ cmake ../src
(this generates makefiles -- cmake may also be used for configuring build parameters (optional))
ratesync/out$ make
ratesync/out$ ./ratesync -h

All set!
